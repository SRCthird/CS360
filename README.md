**1. Requirements and Goals:**  
The app was designed to help users manage inventory by tracking item in locations within a business, addressing the need for quick, organized stock management.

**2. Screens and Features:**  
Essential screens included are home screen with inventory lists, item creation/edit forms, login page, and sms notification page, all built with clean navigation and minimal steps to ensure ease of use and intuitive flow for users.

**3. Coding Approach:**  
I used modular coding practices, separating logic into manageable classes and methods, along with consistent naming conventions. It really helps that android studio gives feedback on almost every variable/method created. These techniques improve maintainability and will be valuable for scaling future projects.

**4. Testing Process:**  
I tested functionality by running the app on an emulator, I would have tested on a physical devices as well but I have apple now :(. Checking each feature individually was also important because testing makes for reliability and helped catch usability issues early.

**5. Design and Development Process:**  
During development, I had to innovate by designing a flexible item transfer system that didn't get too into the actual logistics behind inventory management. I have a tendancy to make everything I do 100% usable which leads me to late projects, so I had to make sure I was only doing what was asked of me.

**6. Area of Success:**  
I was pretty successful in creating the inventory transfer feature, which demonstrated the ability to combine data management, UI design, and responsive interaction in a real-world business context.
